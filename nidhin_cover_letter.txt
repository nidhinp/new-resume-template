Dear HR Manager:

This letter is to express my interest in your opening for an experienced Software Developer. With a bachelor degree in Computer Science Engineering and hands-on experience using Python, Swift and Objective C languages to create and implement software applications, I am confident I will be an asset to your organization.

I enjoy being challenged and working on projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me and the success of your organization.

Your listed requirements closely match my background and skills. A few I would like to highlight that would enable me to contribute to your bottom line are:

1. Highly skilled in designing, testing, and developing software.
2. Knowledgeable of back-end development and native iOS application development.
3. Hands-on software troubleshooting experience


I have attached a copy of my resume that details my projects and experience in software development. I can be reached anytime via my cell phone, +96598933409 or via email at nidhinp.412@gmail.com

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to speaking with you about this opportunity.

Sincerely,

Nidhin P P
